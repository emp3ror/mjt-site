# Tracing the Shape of Code

Designing a personal site starts with the constraints. For this build, the north star is a static export that still feels alive.

> Static-first does not mean lifelessâ€”it means intentional about what truly needs to run on the client.

## Notes from the planning sketch

- Contentlayer owns the data model so we keep MDX portable.
- Light/dark palettes stay in CSS custom properties.
- Keep every fancy animation behind `prefers-reduced-motion` checks.[^motion]

```tsx
export function loadPosts() {
  return sortByDate(allPosts);
}
```

[^motion]: We owe accessibility more than a quick toggle.
