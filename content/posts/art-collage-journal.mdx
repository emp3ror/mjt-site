I keep a box of scraps from every print runâ€”misaligned layers, overexposed scans, the mistakes. They land in the collage journal when the timing feels right.

## Studio ritual

- Stack translucent papers to test how light leaks through.
- Annotate every layer with china marker arrows and timestamps.
- Photograph the spreads in the same window light for continuity.

> Imperfection is proof the work passed through real hands.
