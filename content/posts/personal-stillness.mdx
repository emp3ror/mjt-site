Sometime around sunrise the skyline turns watercolor. I bring a notebook, a mug, and no agenda.

## Things I keep returning to

1. Pencil lines that wobble because my hand is cold.
2. Stories told in soft gradients.
3. Letting drafts stay drafts until the words feel patient.

*"Art isn't what I write, it's the way I listen first."*
