We invite neighbors upstairs while the city is still yawning. The open air keeps the conversation soft, and everyone brings a note from the block they represent.

## Ground rules we revisit

1. Listen in full sentences before proposing fixes.
2. Capture ideas in the open so credit stays visible.
3. Treat disagreement as a design problem, not a dead end.

*“Policy is just community care written down.”*
