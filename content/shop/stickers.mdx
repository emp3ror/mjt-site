## A tiny sticker press

I run a small-batch sticker printing service as a personal vanity project. It keeps the studio printer busy and helps friends ship sharp-looking stickers without minimums that break the bank.

## What you get

- Weather-resistant vinyl with strong adhesive
- Matte or gloss laminate for scuff protection
- Die-cut shapes or clean circles/squares up to A4 footprint
- Color-checked proofs before the final run

## How it works

1. Send your artwork (vector preferred; high-res PNG works too).
2. I share a quick proof with trim lines and color notes.
3. Approve, then I print, laminate, and cut in the studio.
4. Pick up in Kathmandu Valley or ship domestically.

## Pricing notes

Small runs start around NPR 35–50 per piece depending on size, laminate, and cut complexity. Batch pricing drops for larger quantities. Turnaround is usually 3–5 days once artwork is approved.

## Start a run

Drop a note with your design files, size, and quantity through the contact form. I’ll reply with a proof and a final quote before printing.
