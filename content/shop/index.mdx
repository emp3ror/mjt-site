title: "artisan shop"
intro: "An intimate artisan corner by MJT, crafted as a playful vanity project where creativity roams free. Every piece is made in small batches with care, curiosity, and a touch of joyful imperfection. It’s a shop for those who love objects with stories, hand-shaped edges, and a maker’s heartbeat still warm inside."
