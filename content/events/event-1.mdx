## Palette

- Walnut ink
- Indigo powder
- Rice paper rescued from the recycling stack

The page buckles when it dries and that is half the charm. I layer washes, lift pigment with salt, then leave the mistakes visible so the piece keeps breathing.

> Each bloom is a timestamp of the brush pausing for breath.
